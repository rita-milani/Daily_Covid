## Daily Covid
This notebook was built to follow up the evolution of Covid-19. To achieve this, we will work with a daily updated data file with cases and deaths of Covid-19 divided by countries. The file has to be prepared in order to be manipulated using pandas and matplotlib libraries. We want to show the dynamic of the outbreak for the selected countries and worldwide, depicting the evolution of daily and total cases and identifying the most affected countries, as well as calculate the rate of mortality.
